## Additional Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
* The only Quizlet feature unlocked by the extension is _Textbook Solutions_. Other features are hard-paywalled and **CANNOT** be unlocked, please see #215.
* Be aware that this extension will log you out of your quizlet account every time you open a textbook solution.
* Chromium browsers may bother you about having extensions in developer mode, just dismiss the alert to keep the extension running.
* Chromium browsers will complain that the manifest has an unrecognized `browser_specific_settings` key. That's okay because you're loading a _Firefox-compatible_ extension.
* If you think there is a problem with the extension feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rospino74/Quizlet-Bypass/issues/new/choose) üòâ.
